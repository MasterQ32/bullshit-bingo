# Bullshit Bingo

A small implementation of [Bullshit Bingo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzzword_bingo) with [LÃ¶ve2D](https://love2d.org/).

## How to play?

Just click the word that was said with the mouse. When a row, a column or a diagonal is completed, you have won the game
and the a loud **Bullshit!** is said.

To restart the game, the **R** key can be pressed. If the game is won, just click again or use **R** to restart.

## Modify the game
If you want to change the words the bingo provides, just replace the contents of the file `words`. Each line is a possible
word for a bingo cell. Right now, the words are a mix of German and English as it is fit for a lecture i'm hearing.
